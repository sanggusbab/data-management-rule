## Introduction
HandS establishes data management practices as described below in order to enhance management efficiency and awareness of user rights.
The scope of Data Management Rules applies to all data generated by HandS.
Recognizing that excessive regulations could impede creativity and efficiency, HandS acknowledges that all regulations aim to enhance efficiency and creativity through centralized data management.
Regulations are aimed at restricting the minimum behavioral patterns, and HandS will establish regulations through responsible and thoughtful consideration.
Cultural establishment of data management rules takes time, and considering the cost of transforming data due to regulatory changes,
professionalism in regulation formulation and willingness for responsible participation are required.
With the ideology that HandS exists for the growth and benefit of each student,
to ensure fair operation, receive diverse and quality feedback, and enhance members' active participation,
HandS strives to disclose shared information to the widest extent possible.
Primarily, after collecting data, efforts should be made to minimize the possibility of inferring personal information by combining collected information.
HandS recognizes the importance of maintaining security for personally identifiable information,
and endeavors to carefully determine the scope of disclosure based on the content of the data,
or to reprocess the data in line with the scope of disclosure.
## Definition of Terms

    - An object with an address space that can hold data.
    - All folders have {foldername}, {classgroupname}, and {classname}.
- Folder Name (folder code)
    - The folder name is represented as {foldername}.
    - {classname} has the same meaning as the rightmost {class##} in {foldername}. "##" can be replaced with other characters.
    - Generally, the {foldername} of the parent folder is represented as {classgroupname}. Details are covered in the regulations.
    - Usually, {foldername} is expressed as "{classgroupname}\_{classname}". Details are covered in the regulations.
- Server
    - A device or system that contains and provides access to data.
- Server Folder
    - The {classname} of the server folder is represented as {default}.

- File
    - Data located at the end of a folder.
    - All files have {classgroupname}, {filename}, and {ext}.
- File Name (file code)
    - The file name is represented by shortening "full filename including extension" to {fullfilenameIE}.
    - Partial file name is represented by shortening "filename including extension" to {filenameIE}.
    - The string that appropriately represents the content of the file is {filename}.
    - The file extension is represented as {ext}.
    - Generally, the {foldername} of the parent folder is represented as {classgroupname}. Details are covered in the regulations.
    - Usually, {filenameIE} is expressed as {filename}.{ext}. Details are covered in the regulations.

    - Alternative
- Reference (reference code)
    - The reference is represented as {ref}.
    - It assists in indexing and intuitive understanding of data as metadata.
- Index (index code)
    - The index is represented as {index}.
    - Provides a neat UI when sorting within a folder.
- Dependency
    - Dependency refers to the likelihood that a logical relationship between sub-data based on one folder or file will be maintained in the long term.
    - For example, the dependency between an application folder and a library is very strong.
## Regulations
The terms covered in the "Definition of Terms" have the same meanings as the terms covered in these regulations.
##### Article 01. Agreement
- 01.01. All matters related to the data structure are determined by the "HandS Data Structure Committee" (hereinafter referred to as the "Committee").
- 01.02. The "Committee" is composed of at least three executives, including the president and server administrators.
  - 01.02.01. The members of the "Committee" are appointed by the president.
- 01.03. Only HandS executives are eligible to propose to the "Committee".
- 01.04. The "Committee" holds "Data Structure Meetings" (hereinafter referred to as "Meetings") at least once a year to adjust the regulations.
  - 01.04.01. Only proposals that are passed unanimously by the "Committee" can be reflected in the regulations through adjustments.
- 01.05. Data not subject to regulations and exceptions are modified to be subject to the regulations.
- 01.06. The "Committee" strives to enhance the understanding of regulation among data users.
- 01.07. The "Data Management Regulations" are posted in an easily accessible location.
- 01.08. Accounts with read or write permissions in the "Committee" update their passwords at least once a year.
  - 01.08.01. Account change history is stored on a data server accessible by only a minimal number of individuals.
  - 01.08.02. Plans to notify authorized personnel of modifications before account changes are made.
- 01.09. When establishing a server, server administrators create an "everyone" account with access to at least one local directory. The ID, password, and access method of this account are posted in an easily accessible location.
- 01.10. Personal information-related content is disclosed as little as possible.
- 01.11. To enhance HandS' autonomy, responsibility, and creativity, information that can be shared is disclosed to the maximum extent possible.
- 01.12. All data management devices are installed in physically secure spaces with controlled access.
- 01.13. When regulations are amended, the "Committee" formulates implementation plans and plans for education and distribution of revised regulations to ensure their practical application and establishment.
- 01.14. Design server logical classification of data to a minimum and design logical classification of data sets with strong dependencies as small as possible, increasing the possibility of division of labor and partial improvement.
  - Additional Explanation 1: The number of logical classifications is inversely proportional to the size of data sets with strong dependencies.
  - Additional Explanation 2: The size of dependent file sets is directly proportional to the number of data sets with strong dependencies.
  - Conclusion for 1 and 2: It is not possible to reduce the number of sets of data sets with strong dependencies while minimizing logical classifications. (Limit)
  - Final Solution: Choose to minimize the logical classification of server data and logical classification of data sets with strong dependencies, respectively.
  - Explanation: This involves applying data tree structure optimizing and modular optimizing.
  - Explanation 2: Regardless of any logical relationship, a clear and minimal relationship is pursued.
  - Explanation 3: Data tree structure optimizing is good as time complexity approaches NlogN, but practical readability improves with modular optimizing.
  - Note: Article 14 is a mechanism that embodies the fundamental ideology pursued by HandS in central data management.
- 01.15. The "Committee" conducts regulatory compliance surveys at least once a year, prepares "Data Management Reports" as reference materials for meetings, and actively addresses issues.
- 01.16. Data considered assets to be protected by HandS may include the text "@copyright" above the preface or be moved together.
  - 01.16.01. The original copyright of assets provided to HandS belongs entirely to the member. HandS does its best to prevent unauthorized use by third parties to protect the rights of the original authors.
  - 01.16.02. Assets provided to HandS in the form of donations also take steps to prevent unauthorized use by third parties to protect HandS' own rights.
  - 01.16.03. Utilization that does not exceed the scope of usage categories for each asset by third parties is considered fair use.
- 01.17. All data includes metadata such as {Data Name}, {Permission Account}, {Account-Specific Permissions}, {Main Department}, {Collaborating Department}, {Production Department}.
  - 01.17.01. Recording metadata may have limited value, so it is not necessary to record it for all data.
  - 01.17.02. Server administrators post as much metadata and information on utilization methods as possible on the server to increase server utilization rates.
  - 01.17.03. Server administrators are assigned the production department of data created during server creation.

##### Article 02. Basics
- 02.01. Set {default} as "HS."
- 02.02. When using {ref}, add "\_{ref}" to the right of {classname}.
- 02.03. When using {ref}, add "\_{ref}" to the right of {filename}.
- 02.04. It is not possible to have {foldername} with only {verx-x} without {ref}.
  - 02.04.01. When using both {verx-x} and {ref}, add "\_{verx-x}\_{ref}" to the right of {classname}.
- 02.05. It is not possible to have {fullfilenameIE} with only {verx-x} without {ref}.
  - 02.05.01. When using both {verx-x} and {ref}, add "\_{verx-x}\_{ref}" to the right of {filename}.
- 02.06. When using {index}, add "{index}\_" to the left of {classname}.
- 02.07. When using {index}, add "{index}\_" to the left of {filename}.
- 02.08. {classgroupname} is the string obtained from {foldername} of the parent folder, with "{index}\_", "\_{verx-x}", and "\_{ref}" removed.
- 02.09. {index} is a string consisting of a sequence of numbers.
- 02.10. Include "{classgroupname}\_" at the beginning of all {foldername} and {fullfilenameIE}.
- 02.11. The {foldername} of server folders is configured by the server administrator according to the server operating system.
- 02.12. {foldername} is "{classgroupname}\_{index}\_{classname}\_{verx-x}\_{ref}."
  - 02.12.01. In {foldername}, "\_{index}", "\_{verx-x}", and "\_{ref}" can be omitted.
- 02.13. {filenameIE} is "{filename}\_{verx-x}\_{ref}.{ext}."
  - 02.13.01. If "\_{verx-x}" and "\_{ref}" are not used, they are omitted in {filenameIE} according to the respective unused elements.
- 02.14. {fullfilenameIE} is "{classgroupname}\_{index}\_{filenameIE}."
  - 02.14.01. If "\_{index}" is not used, it is omitted in {fullfilenameIE}.
- 02.15. {classgroupname} is "{default}\_{class01}\_{class02}\_{class03}...".

##### Article 03. Additional Provisions

- 03.01. For data with strong dependencies, the {default} value of all data except the top-level folder or file in the set is updated to {classname} or {filename} of the top-level folder or file.
  - 03.01.01. Data with strong dependencies on specific data spaces include "{classgroupname}\_" referencing the {classgroupname} of that data space at the left end of the {default} string.
  - 03.01.02. Data with strong dependencies on servers include "HS\_" at the left end of the {default} string.
  - 03.01.03. There can be multiple top-level folders or files, satisfying {default}={classname}={filename} at that time. Additionally, they share the same folder with {classgroupname}.
- 03.02. {foldername} and {fullfilenameIE} consist only of English letters, numbers, and underscores.
- 03.03. All folders include a README.txt file containing information about the functions performed in each folder.

##### Article 04. Extensions
- 04.01. It is recommended to use {verx-x} as {RVS}{YYYY}{MM}{DD} to align the number of characters and use the date format.
  - 04.01.01. Special-purpose usage of {verx-x}
    - {RVS}: RevisionCode: Used to indicate the revision sequence between similar files. (3 characters)
    - {YYYY}: YearCode: Used to indicate the year. (4 characters)
    - {MM}: MonthCode: Used to indicate the month. (2 characters)
    - {DD}: DayCode: Used to indicate the day. (2 characters)
- 04.02. It is recommended to establish the data structure with divisibility in mind.
- 04.03. To use sorting functionality effectively in folders, it is recommended to append {index} based on usage frequency or purpose.
  - 04.03.01. Set {index} based on usage purpose within a folder, and then adjust {index} based on usage frequency among adjacent {index} within the same folder.
- 04.04. It is recommended to use {index} in the form of "@#&" with "@" not being "0," as {Index}'s basic increment is granted through the increase of {#}.
  - 04.04.01. This is a technique of offset, pre-allocating space. Depending on the nature of the data to be added later, numbers may need to be inserted between adjacent {index}. Up to 9 {index} can be inserted between two {index}. While using "@" to represent "0" might not have a significant difference in the functionality of inserting between two {index}, it would prevent assigning {index} less than "000." If "@" is set to "0," it is recommended to set "#" to a non-zero value.
  - 04.04.02. There are multiple patterns (with an interval of 10) that can have nearly the same effect as described in 04.04.01. Each has slightly different features. It is also possible to use a different sequence of numbers that is not an arithmetic sequence of 10, based on your design.
  - 04.04.03. Applying the above methods might reduce readability. When inserting {index} in between, if the number of {index} used is not many, manually modifying the {index} of data might be acceptable.
- 04.05. Storing data in compressed file formats like .zip is not recommended (reduces indexing and data accessibility, lowers data reuse).
- 04.06. The parts enclosed in curly braces "{}" are referred to as Division Code.
- 04.07. Do not use whitespace in filenames and folder names. For readability, in the case of word combinations, only the leftmost character of a word or string unit that can have a meaning should be capitalized.
- 04.08. For instance, for data sets with strong dependencies like VisualStudio project folders, the top-level data can have {default} set to an empty string "".
  - 04.08.01. Article 04.08 acts as a clause that can release most of the restrictions on the format of {foldername} and {fullfilenameIE}. It should be utilized with an understanding of other regulations.
- 04.09. By default, the {ref} used in {foldername} is a code that assists in describing a short code {classname}. However, for {filename}, it is recommended to follow the convention of {ref} used in {foldername} rather than using a short string format.
  - 04.09.01. For {filename} in {fullfilenameIE}, if {filename} is written in a short code format and {ref} is used, {fullfilenameIE} unnecessarily lengthens. Therefore, for data files that are not at the top of data sets with high dependency, it is recommended to follow Article 04.09.
- 04.10. Article 05.03.03 recommends omitting {classgroupname} in README.txt.
- 04.11. In Article 03.01.03, {index}, {verx-x}, and {ref} of the top-level data are managed independently.
- 04.12. By not using "{index}\_", "\_{verx-x}", "\_{ref}" appropriately, {filename} or {classname} can be used as a long code. This is recommended as you get closer to the leaf of the data set.
- 04.13. It is recommended to use a short code for {classname}, consisting of 2-4 characters.
- 04.14. It is recommended that {classname} does not start with a number.
- 04.15. When copying data from other folders, no data name needs to be modified as per Article 04.08.
  - 04.15.01. If the copied data is independently modified in both the original and copied locations, synchronization issues may arise. Therefore, utilize shortcut files (.lnk) to maintain roles for each folder and enable inter-departmental file sharing.
  - 04.15.02. The {filename} of the shortcut file (.lnk) should include the entire data name excluding {ext} of the original data. This maintains roles for each folder and enables inter-departmental file sharing.
##### Article 05. Exceptions
- 05.01. If a data set is determined to have low dependency, the application of Article 04.08 for files can be denied.
- 05.02. If there is a purpose to use Korean in folder names and file names, Korean may be allowed in {filename} and {ref}.
- 05.03. It may be allowed not to create README.txt files as per the following clauses:
  - 05.03.01. For folders created for temporary use
  - 05.03.02. When README.txt is duplicated due to dependency issues in applications
  - 05.03.03. When the nature of the folder frequently changes and the contents of README.txt are expected to be frequently modified
  - 05.03.04. When the purpose of the folder is self-evident without the need for a separate README.txt
  - 05.03.05. When README.txt adversely affects the dependency of the data set
  - 05.03.06. When writing README.txt is inefficient compared to the usage rate of the folder
  - 05.03.07. When the content of README.txt matches or is very similar to the content of files within the folder
  - 05.03.08. When there are no sub-data within the folder or the folder is part of a data set under design
  - 05.03.09. When the function of the folder can be explained only in very specialized terms
- 05.04. The creation of the everyone account mentioned in Article 01.09 may not be allowed based on the "consortium" decision depending on the nature of the server.
- 05.05. When the space required by Article 01.12 for {ext} of data is difficult to obtain due to cost or administrative issues, temporarily placing it in a physically accessible space may be allowed.
  - 05.05.01. When placing it in a physically accessible space, prepare or plan for a backup server by integrating it with cloud services to prepare for any contingencies.
  - 05.05.02. To prevent incidents, for appropriate subsequent actions, place it in a location with installation such as video recording devices or other access control devices.
- 05.06. If users consider data management devices to be of low reliability for experimentation, testing purposes, or data management, they can be excluded from data management devices subject to Article 01.12.
- 05.07. While {verx-x} and {index} have fundamentally different purposes, both can potentially be used to distinguish folders or files. Inappropriate mixing may lead to inconsistency, loss of universality, and thus may not be allowed.
- 05.08. If there is a sufficient reason not to use the entire data name excluding {ext} in Article 04.15.02, omit "{classgroupname}\_" and create {filename}.lnk, this may be allowed.
